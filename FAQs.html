                            Fontshare is a free fonts service founded by the Indian Type Foundry (ITF). Fontshare offers professional grade fonts that are free for personal and commercial use. You can either use a CSS code to access fonts directly from the Fontshare API, download
                            an offline kit and self-host them or use them on your desktop to create anything you like.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-5">
                            Currently there are two types of free fonts offered on Fontshare: “Closed Source” and “Open Source”. Closed Source fonts are proprietary freeware designed, produced and owned by the parent company of Fontshare, the Indian Type Foundry (ITF) and are governed
                            by ITF’s Free Font License (FFL).
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-5">
                            Closed Source fonts are also exclusive to Fontshare, meaning you won’t find them anywhere else on the internet.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-5">
                            Open Source fonts, on the other hand, are the property of their respective designers and publishers, and are governed by SIL Open Font License (OFL). Fontshare identifies top notch open source fonts from the internet, reviews their quality, fixes design
                            or technical bugs, and hosts the latest versions on Fontshare so you don’t have to go anywhere else. All the fonts offered on Fontshare are free fonts of the highest standard.

                            Most free fonts that are available online are of a poor quality. We pride ourselves on the quality and technical specification of all the fonts offered on Fontshare. You can determine the quality of a typeface by examining the drawing of letters, spacing,
                            kerning, OpenType features, character sets, language support, the availability of weights, italics and newer font formats, such as variable fonts.

                        <p class="mb-5">
                            All “Closed Source” fonts have undergone a thorough design process and are proprietary freeware designed, produced and owned by the Indian Type Foundry (ITF). These fonts have the same quality as ITF’s other commercial fonts. All Closed Source fonts are
                            exclusive to Fontshare and are governed by ITF’s Free Font License (FFL).
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-5">
                            All Open Source fonts are not designed or owned by ITF, however, we make sure that these fonts go through our strict selection process before appearing on Fontshare. We only offer fonts from reputable foundries and designers that are original, have the
                            highest design standards and are 100% free for both Commercial and Personal use.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-5">
                            All Open Source fonts are governed by the SIL Open Font License (OFL). A large proportion of the free fonts available online are ripped-off versions of proprietary fonts and do not have enough information about the creator, so there is always the threat
                            of legal action being taken by the original owner. This is why we do not distribute fonts that have dubious origins, have vague licensing terms, are partially free, or are just free for personal use. All Fontshare fonts are
                            100% free for personal and commercial use and are backed by a proper EULA. Using Fontshare fonts means that you’re legally protected.

                            modified or redistributed by other free font websites. Users must use the fonts supplied by ITF on the Fontshare platform as they appear. These fonts are also available exclusively on Fontshare, meaning you won’t find them
                            anywhere else. If you see a website distributing one of our Closed Source fonts, they’re distributing it illegally and you should refrain from downloading our fonts from such websites.

                            might see that some of the open source fonts that are offered on Fontshare are also available on other websites. But unlike other websites who host whatever they find, Fontshare identifies top-notch open source fonts, reviews
                            their quality, fixes design or technical bugs, and hosts the latest versions on Fontshare. If you see an open source font hosted on Fontshare, you can rest assured that it’s the latest version and a free font of the highest
                            standard.

                            Fontshare is a free fonts service founded by the Indian Type Foundry (ITF). Fontshare offers professional grade fonts that are free for personal and commercial use. You can either use a CSS code to access fonts directly from the Fontshare API, download
                            an offline kit and self-host them or use them on your desktop to create anything you like.

                        <p class="mb-5">
                            Currently there are two types of free fonts offered on Fontshare: “Closed Source” and “Open Source”. Closed Source fonts are proprietary freeware designed, produced and owned by the parent company of Fontshare, the Indian Type Foundry (ITF) and are governed
                            by ITF’s Free Font License (FFL).
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-5">
                            Closed Source fonts are also exclusive to Fontshare, meaning you won’t find them anywhere else on the internet.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-5">
                            Open Source fonts, on the other hand, are the property of their respective designers and publishers, and are governed by SIL Open Font License (OFL). Fontshare identifies top notch open source fonts from the internet, reviews their quality, fixes design
                            or technical bugs, and hosts the latest versions on Fontshare so you don’t have to go anywhere else. All the fonts offered on Fontshare are free fonts of the highest standard.

                            Most free fonts that are available online are of a poor quality. We pride ourselves on the quality and technical specification of all the fonts offered on Fontshare. You can determine the quality of a typeface by examining the drawing of letters, spacing,
                            kerning, OpenType features, character sets, language support, the availability of weights, italics and newer font formats, such as variable fonts.

                            All Open Source fonts are not designed or owned by ITF, however, we make sure that these fonts go through our strict selection process before appearing on Fontshare. We only offer fonts from reputable foundries and designers that are original, have the
                            highest design standards and are 100% free for both Commercial and Personal use.

                            All Open Source fonts are governed by the SIL Open Font License (OFL). A large proportion of the free fonts available online are ripped-off versions of proprietary fonts and do not have enough information about the creator, so there is always the threat
                            of legal action being taken by the original owner. This is why we do not distribute fonts that have dubious origins, have vague licensing terms, are partially free, or are just free for personal use. All Fontshare fonts are
                            100% free for personal and commercial use and are backed by a proper EULA. Using Fontshare fonts means that you’re legally protected.

                            Fontshare is a free fonts service founded by the Indian Type Foundry (ITF). Fontshare offers professional grade fonts that are free for personal and commercial use. You can either use a CSS code to access fonts directly from the Fontshare API, download
                            an offline kit and self-host them or use them on your desktop to create anything you like.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-5">
                            Currently there are two types of free fonts offered on Fontshare: “Closed Source” and “Open Source”. Closed Source fonts are proprietary freeware designed, produced and owned by the parent company of Fontshare, the Indian Type Foundry (ITF) and are governed
                            by ITF’s Free Font License (FFL).
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-5">
                            Closed Source fonts are also exclusive to Fontshare, meaning you won’t find them anywhere else on the internet.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-5">
                            Open Source fonts, on the other hand, are the property of their respective designers and publishers, and are governed by SIL Open Font License (OFL). Fontshare identifies top notch open source fonts from the internet, reviews their quality, fixes design
                            or technical bugs, and hosts the latest versions on Fontshare so you don’t have to go anywhere else. All the fonts offered on Fontshare are free fonts of the highest standard.
